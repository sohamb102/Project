Task: To Predict the risk of getting covid-19 based on symptoms

In the month of March 2020 when covid-19 had just started in India there was a fear among everyone of getting covid. When people got normal cold, cough they were feared that they got covid. 
So there was a need to understand if the symptoms of a sick person could indicate if he/she was having covid. 
In this Project we try to understand the risk of getting covid based on various symptoms

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib
Machine Learning model: Logistic Regression

A dataset that contained various types of symptoms and the risk of covid was used. Logistic Regression model was used for training. After training the model, the model could detect the risk of getting covid based on various symptoms.

Note: This project was developed at the time of first covid wave. More Symptoms can be added in this.

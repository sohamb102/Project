Task: To study statewise covid-19 cases

In march 2020 covid-19 cases started to spread in India. There was a fear and panic situation among the people. There was no exact details of total covid-19 cases. Every source showed different numbers. Hence there was a need to develop a platform to show the exact number of covid-19 cases. Also to study its spread in different states, statewise numbers of covid-19 cases was required.
Hence to provide a solution to this problem we developed a platform to study covid-19 cases statewise.

Programming language: Python
Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib

A dataset that contained Statewise Confirmed, Cured and Death cases was used for this project.
Note: The dataset used had data till 6/8/2021
